# Weather Forecast App

## Description

 This weather applicationhas been programmed to show the current weather for a city that the user has searched for as well as 5 days of weather forecasted.  

 The homepage will display a Weather Dashboard that displays the current date, temperature, wind speed and humidity for the day along with an icon to match. Below that it will have 5 future days forecasted with the same information for the city in question. 


## User Interface

There is a form input on the left hand side that allows the user to search for any city by typing it in.  

If the user's connection is not strong enough to retrieve the data, it will prompt "Network problems. Unable to get weather" so the user is aware of the issue.
