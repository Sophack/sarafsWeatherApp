By default the city it shows is Atlanta (as per the mockup requirements). 

When the user types a city name & clicks the search button, they are able to view the 5 day weather forecast. This includes the current day (updated every 3 hours) as well as the 5 following days. The temperature, windspeed and humidity are shown for all 5 days with a corresponding weather icon. This info is added to the search history which is displayed on the left under the search bar. The search bar is not case sensitive so the user does not have to capitalize.   


The following image shows the application page after the user searches for "Montreal". The temperature, wind speed and humidity is all displayed for the current day as well as 5 following days. 
The history is saved so the user can refer back to previous cities and their information. The next city to be searched is New York.

This is what happens when the user searches for a new city. New York's weather info is now displayed as well as stored by means of local storage on the left hand-side.
