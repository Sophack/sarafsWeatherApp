By default the city it shows is Atlanta (as per the mockup requirements). 

When the user types a city name & clicks the search button, they are able to view the 5 day weather forecast. This includes the current day (updated every 3 hours) as well as the 5 following days. The temperature, windspeed and humidity are shown for all 5 days with a corresponding weather icon. This info is added to the search history which is displayed on the left under the search bar. The search bar is not case sensitive so the user does not have to capitalize.
